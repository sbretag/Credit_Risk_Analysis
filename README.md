# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Use a credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer to peer lending services company, we've been tasked to utilize machine learning models to predict credit risk and produce an evaluation of the model performance with including recommendations.  The following deliverables are required.
  - Use resampling models to predict credit risk
  - Use SMOTEENN algorithm to predict credit risk
  - Use ensemble classifiers to predict credit risk
  - Produce a written report on the credit risk analysis

## Results
- Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models.  Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results

## Summary
- Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any.  If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
